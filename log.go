// other logs.

// A primary signer must be provided:
// - the primary signer is the "canonical" signing identity which should be used when creating new checkpoints.
//
// Zero or more dditional signers may also be provided.
// This enables cases like:
//   - a rolling key rotation, where checkpoints are signed by both the old and new keys for some period of time,
//   - using different signature schemes for different audiences, etc.
//
// When providing additional signers, their names MUST be identical to the primary signer name, and this name will be used
// as the checkpoint Origin line.

// required for entries to be included in the log.

//   - helps show that the log is "live", even if no entries are being added.
//   - enables clients of the log to reason about how frequently they need to have their
