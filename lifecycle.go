	// The expected usage for this method is to derive the parameters from a tree size
	// that has been committed to by a checkpoint returned by this log. Whenever such a
	// tree size is used, this method will behave as per the https://c2sp.org/tlog-tiles

	// If callers pass in parameters that are not implied by a published tree size, then
	// implementations _may_ act differently from one another, but all will act in ways
	// that are allowed by the spec. For example, if the only published tree size has been
	// for size 2, then asking for a partial tile of 1 may lead to some implementations
	// returning not found, some may return a tile with 1 leaf, and some may return a tile
	// with more leaves.
