Trillian Tessera is a Go library for building [tile-based transparency logs (tlogs)](https://c2sp.org/tlog-tiles).
It is the logical successor to the approach [Trillian v1][] takes in building and operating logs.

The implementation and its APIs bake-in
[current best-practices based on the lessons learned](https://transparency.dev/articles/tile-based-logs/)
over the past decade of building and operating transparency logs in production environments and at scale.

Tessera was introduced at the Transparency.Dev summit in October 2024.
Watch [Introducing Trillian Tessera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j_8FbQ9qSc) for all the details,
but here's a summary of the high level goals:

*   [tlog-tiles API][] and storage
*   Support for both cloud and on-premises infrastructure
    *   [GCP](./storage/gcp/)
    *   AWS (#24)
    *   [MySQL](./storage/mysql/)
    *   [POSIX](./storage/posix/)
*   Make it easy to build and deploy new transparency logs on supported infrastructure
    *   Library instead of microservice architecture
    *   No additional services to manage
    *   Lower TCO for operators compared with Trillian v1
*   Fast sequencing and integration of entries
*   Optional functionality which can be enabled for those ecosystems/logs which need it (only pay the cost for what you need):
    *   "Best-effort" de-duplication of entries
    *   Synchronous integration
*   Broadly similar write-throughput and write-availability, and potentially _far_ higher read-throughput
    and read-availability compared to Trillian v1 (dependent on underlying infrastructure)
*   Enable building of arbitrary log personalities, including support for the peculiarities of a
    [Static CT API][] compliant log.

The main non-goal is to support transparency logs using anything other than the [tlog-tiles API][].
While it is possible to deploy a custom personality in front of Tessera that adapts the tlog-tiles API
into any other API, this strategy will lose a lot of the read scaling that Tessera is designed for.

### Status

Tessera is under active development, with the [alpha](https://github.com/orgs/transparency-dev/projects/2/views/3) milestone coming soon. 
Users of GCP, MySQL, and POSIX are welcome to try the relevant [Getting Started](#getting-started) guide.

### Roadmap

Alpha expected by Q4 2024, and production ready in the first half of 2025.

#### Whatâ€™s happening to Trillian v1?

[Trillian v1][] is still in use in production environments by
multiple organisations in multiple ecosystems, and is likely to remain so for the mid-term. 

New ecosystems, or existing ecosystems looking to evolve, should strongly consider planning a
migration to Tessera and adopting the patterns it encourages.
Note that to achieve the full benefits of Tessera, logs must use the [tlog-tiles API][].

### Getting started

The best place to start is the codelab provided in the [conformance](./cmd/conformance/) directory.
This will walk you through setting up your first log, writing some entries to it via HTTP, and inspecting the contents.

Take a look at the example personalities in the `/cmd/` directory:
  - [posix](./cmd/conformance/posix/): example of operating a log backed by a local filesystem
    - This example runs an HTTP web server that takes arbitrary data and adds it to a file-based log.
  - [mysql](./cmd/conformance/mysql/): example of operating a log that uses MySQL
    - This example is easiest deployed via `docker compose`, which allows for easy setup and teardown.
  - [gcp](./cmd/conformance/gcp/): example of operating a log running in GCP
    - This example can be deployed via terraform (see the [deployment](./deployment/) directory).
  - [posix-oneshot](./cmd/examples/posix-oneshot/): exmaple of a command line tool to add entries to a log stored on the local filesystem
    - This example is not a long-lived process; running the command integrates entries into the log which lives only as files.

The `main.go` files for each of these example personalities try to strike a balance when demonstrating features of Tessera between simplicity, and demonstrating best practices.
Please raise issues against the repo, or chat to us in [Slack](#contact) if you have ideas for making the examples more accessible!
